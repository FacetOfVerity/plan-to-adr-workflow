# Implement Plan

**CRITICAL:** You MUST invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "plan-to-adr-workflow"` BEFORE doing anything else.

Do NOT proceed without loading the skill first. The skill contains:
- Plan selection logic (active/backlog folders)
- Task execution workflow with checkboxes
- Progress tracking and status updates
- ADR archival process

After the skill is loaded, follow the **"Execute Plan Workflow"** section exactly.
