# Commit Plan

**CRITICAL:** You MUST invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "plan-to-adr-workflow"` BEFORE doing anything else.

Do NOT proceed without loading the skill first. The skill contains:
- Complete instructions for analyzing current discussion
- Plan template with all required sections
- File naming conventions (YYYY-MM-DD_name.md)
- STATUS.md update rules

After the skill is loaded, follow the **"Save Plan Workflow"** section exactly.
